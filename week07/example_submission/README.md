# Verification of ML Assigment 1 submission file (.zip)

The `ver.py` script in this repository runs tests on your [ML Assignment 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WGYw99e5q6j5V0Zrf2HveagU6URt_kVvdR8B9HYQ99E/edit?usp=sharing) submission file (.zip) to verify it meets the submission requirements. 

## Instructions for using this script to test your submission .zip file:

1. Save `ver.py` on your local drive, preferably in the directory containing your assignment files.  
2. In the terminal, navigate to the directory where you have saved `ver.py`.  
3. In the terminal, run the `python` command with two arguments: 1) the name of the verification script (`ver.py`) and 2) the full file path of the location of your submission (.zip) file.  

**For example:**  
`python ver.py '/Users/aaronhill/Dropbox/data/ml_new/ML_1_sub_test/hal'`  

*Where `ver.py` is in the present working directory and `/Users/aaronhill/Dropbox/data/ml_new/ML_1_sub_test/hal` contains the contents of my .zip submission.*

**If a .zip file meets the submission requirements, the output to the console will always end with:**  
`SUCCESS!`

**Otherwise, the output will end with errors that describe the problem(s) with the submission file.**

## Example of a successful submission file

```
$ ls
README.md		hal			test_files_for.ipynb
Untitled.ipynb		oops			tests.ipynb
another			test.csv		ver.py
$ python ver.py '/Users/aaronhill/Dropbox/data/ml_new/ML_1_sub_test/hal'
test subdirectory already exists
